            4. Check if the showSeats are available
            5. If showSeats are available, then BLOCKED the seats.
            6. After blocking the seats, then calculate the entire amount for the booking show
            7. Create the booking for that particular user and return the booking back to the client
            8. Approach 1: Now take  a lock for entire booking, then, unlocking later. So, one user will create booking at one time (i.e) take a lock on entirely
               This will run sequentially not in parallel

            Approach 2: Run it in parallel like double check locking. See the steps in comment section
